# Todo List for TECH3015

This is a *very basic* todo list.

It does **NOT** store anything in any way, so a page refresh/reload will clear all data!

There are some simple console.log statements to show how the program runs.

## Task 1: Create the interface

This is done with a very simple form in HTML. No particular styling has been added.

The todos are displayed on screen using an HTML table, added dynamically via JS.

## Task 2: Add a todo

This takes content from the form and adds it into the todos object.

## Task 3: View the todos

The table gets drawn everytime the user makes a change or adds a new todo.

## Task 4: Completing a todo

The user can complete a todo by ticking a checkbox. This status is stored in the todos object.

## Extras:

- [x] Deleting a todo
- [x] Editing a todo
- [x] Reset to today on creating/editing to-dos
- [x] Make it look better (a bit)
- [ ] Use localStorge for data
- [ ] Enable reordering the list
